# When you run the code below, you'll get SyntaxErrors.
# The variable names are all messed up and don't follow the rules!
# Fix the variable names so the code works as expected.

stvariable1 = "40" # Fixed variable name by removing the number 1
second_variable = "2" # bad practices and spaces will not work. Used Snake

result = stvariable1 + second_variable # finally is a reserverd word. 
print(result) # Updated variable name
