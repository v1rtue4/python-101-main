# The code below works as expected and there are no errors.
# However, the variable names aren't great and don't follow the guidelines.
# Improve the variable names so they follow the PEP-8 guidelines.

name = "Ada"
last_name = "Lovelace"
full_name = name + " " + last_name

print(full_name)

# Renamed variables to follow PEP-8 guidelines:
# Used all lowercase letters
# Replaced spaces in multi-word names with underscores
# Updated all variable references to match the new names
