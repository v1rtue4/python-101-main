# Improve the variable assignment shown below.
# Why should you change it?

#color, year = "red", 1900

color = "red"
year = 1990

print(color, year)

# Separated the variables to improve clarity and readability.
# Avoided multiple assignment since 'color' and 'year' are unrelated values.
# This makes the code easier to understand and follow, especially for beginners.
