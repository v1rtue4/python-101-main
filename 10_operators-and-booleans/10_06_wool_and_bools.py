# Write a code snippet that gives a name to a `sheep`
# and uses a boolean value to define whether it has `wool` or not.

# Assign name for sheep using string
sheep_name = "puffy"

# Boolean to indicate if sheep has wool
# True means it has wool
has_wool = True

# Display results if sheep's name has wool. 
print(sheep_name)
