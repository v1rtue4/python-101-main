# Think about a task that you want to accomplish using programming
# Maybe you want to automate something you do every day on your computer?
# Break down some of the steps you can think of and write them in
# this file as pseudocode.
# You can come back and update this file when you've learned more.
# You can also add real Python code after learning the necessary concepts.
# For now, just practice breaking larger tasks into smaller steps
# and writing out your thoughts in pseudocode.


# Goal: Use my CSV to help populate missing data in HR's CSV
# 1. Load both CSV files (my file and HR's file)
# 2. Loop through each row in HR's CSV
#    a. For each row, check if any key info (like Employee ID) is missing
#    b. If it is missing, look up that person in my CSV using a matching field (like name or email)
#    c. If a match is found, fill in the missing data (e.g., Employee ID)
# 3. Save the updated HR CSV with the newly filled data
